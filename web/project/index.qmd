## Final Project Information

The requirements for the final project can be found [here](./final-project-requirements.qmd).

Checkoffs for the proposal debrief, midpoint demo, and final checkoff can be scheduled on the Google Sheet found [here]({{< var project-checkoff-gsheet-url >}}).
You should sign up for a slot as a team, not as individuals.

All submissions for the project are as a team and should be submitted on Canvas as group submissions.
