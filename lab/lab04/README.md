# Starter Code for Digital Audio Lab
The starter code for this lab contains an array of the note pitches and durations for FÃ¼r Elise.
Your job is to write code in main to implement the timer functionality on the MCU to generate the required output signals (square waves at specified frequencies) for the required note durations in order to play the song.
