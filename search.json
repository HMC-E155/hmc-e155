    "text": "Introduction\nLattice Radiant is the synthesis tool provided by Lattice Semiconductor for targeting their FPGA devices.\n\n\nDownload\nDownload the software installer from Lattice’s website for your operating system from this link Lattice Radiant Software. (Windows and Linux only. You will need to use virtualization to use Radiant on Mac.) The current version as of this writing is 2023.1. You will need to create an account to access the download.\n\n\nWorking with the UPduino v3.1 on macOS\nI use the Windows version in a Parallels Windows 11 Virtual Machine. The synthesis and simulation works without a hitch but the programming is finicky. I suspect it has something to do with some wonkiness with the USB drivers and the Virtual Machine. To work around this, you can use the openFPGALoader project which is universal utility for programming FPGAs. Instructions for installation and use can be found here.\nThe easiest way is to directly install it as a Homebrew formula:\nbrew install openfpgaloader\nAfter installation, to program our UPduino v3.1 board, use the command:\nopenFPGALoader -b ice40_generic -c ft232  -f &lt;path_to_.bin_file&gt;\n\n\nInstallation\nAs part of the installation, make sure to select the iCE40 UltraPlus family device support package along with the Programmer and Mentor ModelSim Lattice Edition. After this menu, click through to finish the installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Installation components to select.\n\n\n\n\n\nLicensing\nTo run Radiant you will need to also request and install a license for the software. Navigate here and request a node-locked license. This license is designed to be run on a single computer.\nTo download the license you will need to find your Host Network Interface Card (NIC) address. To find the NIC address, follow the steps below.\nFor Windows, from an MS-DOS window (command prompt), use the ipconfig /all command\nFor Linux, from the command prompt, use the ifconfig -a command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Finding NIC physical address.\n\n\n\nEnter your Host NIC address (without dashes) and click the required checkbox. You do not need to select any of the optional Radiant Free IP. Then click the “Generate License” button.\nAfter receiving the license file (license.dat), follow the instructions in the email about how to install the license. You should have to place it in the location specified in the email (C:on Windows), select this license location in the FlexNet License Finder window, and set the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable to the path of your license file (instructions). This should ensure that both Radiant and ModelSim are properly licensed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: FlexNet License Finder dialog.\n\n\n\nYou can also check the license paths afterwards by using the License Debug Tool under the Help menu."

    "text": "Background\nIn the 1980’s and 1990’s, digital design projects were built from a truckload of chips, each containing a few logic gates such as 74xx series logic gates or simple programmable array logic chips (PALs). Such projects involve placing and wiring together dozens of chips on a breadboard. It was easy to make a wiring mistake or burn out a chip and spend hours tracking down the problem. Now you can perform all of your digital logic on a single field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to greatly reduce the necessary wiring and number of chips. Later in the course, you will use the Cortex-M4 microcontroller to write programs in assembly language and C that can interface with external hardware and the FPGA."

Section 5.3 of the iCE40 UltraPlus Family Data Sheet (FPGA-DS-02008-2.0) explains the naming of the chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: ice40 Part Number Description\n\n\n\nThe Lattice UP5K is very similar to the Cyclone IV architecture that is used to introduce FPGAs in E85. At its root, the FPGA consists of Logic Cells (Lattice’s version of the Intel/Altera Logic Elements you learned about in E85) which can be internally connected within Programmable Logic Blocks (PLBs) within the FPGA to form digital circuits. Each Logic Cell (LC) consists of a 4-input look-up table (LUT) and a programmable D flip-flop, along with additional clock control and carry logic. Figure 3.2 from the FPGA datasheet shows the basic architecture of a PLB and LC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: ice40 PLB Block Diagram.\n\n\n\nThe UP5K on our UPduino v3.1 board is the 48-pin QFN package. As you can see from the table, it contains 5280 logic cells, 30 Embedded Block Ram (EBR) Memory Blocks of 4 Kbits each, 4 256-bit Single Port synchronous RAM Memory Blocks, and an on-board high-frequency (48 MHz) and low-frequency (10 kHz) oscillator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: ice40 Resource Table.\n\n\n\n\nDigital Design Synthesis and Programming\nThe FPGA is programmed using the onboard programmer via the synthesis tool Lattice Radiant.

    "text": "E155 FA22 Development Board\nIn this lab you will assemble a custom printed circuit board which hosts the MCU and FPGA boards. The board has several features that will be convenient for developing embedded systems such as:\n\nPins which can be directly routed from the MCU to the FPGA via the board\nExtension headers for the mikroBUS and 6-pin PMOD standard\nUser configurable LEDs, pushbuttons, and slider switches.\nHeader to route pins via a ribbon cable to a separate breadboard adapter PCB which can be inserted into a solderless breadboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Annotated sections of the development board.\n\n\n\nThe board has several main sections that you should make yourself aware of. They are annotated in the image above.\n\nVoltage Regulators and Power Terminal: A +5 V (NCP1117DT50RKG) and +3.3 V (NCP1117DT33T5G) low-dropout (LDO) voltage regulator which is used to regulate the input provided via the power terminal on VIN. Make sure to check with the schematic to ensure that you put the regulators in their proper places. See Powering the Board for more details.\nFPGA, MCU, mikroBUS, and PMOD sockets: These sockets are populated with female headers for the MCU, FPGA, and other extension sockets to be plugged into.\nReset Push Buttons: The reset pushbuttons are connected to the reset inputs on the MCU and FPGA respectively. The MCU reset button will cause the code to begin execution from the first instruction. The FPGA reset button causes the FPGA to reconfigure itself from the on-board RAM which stores the configuration file for the design you have uploaded.\nConfiguration Jumpers: The configuration jumpers on the board allow you several options to set the power and signal connections for the MCU and FPGA. J2, J3, and J4 control the mikroBUS reset signal and the power for the FPGA and MCU boards respectively. The mikroBUS reset signal can also be connected to MCU pin PA12 to enable the MCU to reset the connected peripheral via software. The configuration jumper J5 is a 2x8 header with MCU pins on the left hand side and FPGA pins on the right hand side. Note that on the 2023 version of the board, J5 has been replaced with an 8-pin DIP switch with the reference designator SW7. The functionality however, remains the same as the jumper. By attaching a jumper between the pins in the same row, the MCU pin on the left side of the jumper can be directly routed to the FPGA pin on the right hand side via traces on the PCB. This allows for convenient and high-fidelity interfaces between the MCU and the FPGA without the need for external wires.\nRibbon Cable Connector: The ribbon cable connector is used to route a subset of the MCU and FPGA pins out to a cable which connects to the breadboard adapter board.\nMCU, FPGA, and Slide Buttons: The push and slide buttons on the board are routed to pins on the MCU and FPGA in order to provide on-board options to toggle GPIO pins on the respective devices. Note that all of these buttons are configured as active low (i.e., closing the switch connects the pin of the device to ground) without any hardware pullup resistors. In order to use them, you must configure the internal pullup resistors on the MCU or FPGA in order to avoid floating logic levels."

SMT parts are generally preferred on PCBs since they are more compact and easier for machines to solder although THT parts are typically easier for beginners to solder. If you haven’t done much (or any!) SMT soldering before, don’t worry! One of the points of this lab is to give you a chance to develop this skill!\nAll the parts you need to build your board are provided in your kit bag. Typically, it is easiest to start with the SMT parts before soldering the THT parts since the board will lay flat. So we’ll start by soldering the SMT components."

    "section": "Assembly Tips",
    "text": "Assembly Tips\nSoldering is a skill that you need to practice just like anything else. The most important thing to remember when soldering is that it is roughly 100x easier to solder than to desolder a component. So, whenever possible, make sure that you align the component correctly before soldering all the pins. Often the best way to do this is to solder a single pin on one side and then confirm that the component is correctly aligned before soldering the rest of the pins. If something is misaligned, then this will make it easy to correct since you only will need to reflow a single solder joint. A few additional tips:\n\nSoldering often will make you wish you had another hand or two. Soldering SMT components in particular can be a bit tricky because you need to hold the component with tweezers to align it. A good strategy is to first melt a little bit of solder on one of the pads and then grab the component with tweezers while holding the iron in your other hand to reflow the solder and align it.\nWhen soldering THT headers like those used for the sockets, make sure that the headers are oriented correctly (most of the time perpendicular to the PCB surface). One tip is to insert a strip of male headers into a breadboard and then attach the female headers and set the PCB upside down on top of the male headers to solder them. If you do end up making a mistake and need to desolder a strip of header pins, the plastic shroud can be removed in order to let you pull out individual pins. See this YouTube video for an example. Although in the video he shows the example for a male header pin strip, you can do the same thing with a female strip as well."

    "section": "Suggested Soldering Order",
    "text": "Suggested Soldering Order\nBelow is a recommended soldering order.\n\nSolder the voltage regulators. Put a bit of solder on the big square pad and reflow while bringing the regulator on top in order to solder it. You can apply heat to the pad via the metal edge at the top of the regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Voltage regulator soldering procedure.\n\n\n\n\nPrepare to solder the remaining SMT components (resistors, capacitors, and LEDs) by applying a small amount of solder to one pad of the SMT footprints R1-R11, C1-C4, and D1-D8..\nSolder the decoupling (also known as bypass) capacitors C1-C4 around the regulators. These are used to smooth out any transients and ensure smooth, constant voltages. These capacitors have no polarity, so either way is fine.\nNext, solder the resistors on the board. Pay careful attention to make sure that you solder the correct resistors by referring to the board schematic (available on the course website).\nNext solder the LEDs. The LEDs are polarized, so you’ll need to make sure to solder them the right direction or they won’t work. There is an arrow on the bottom of the package which indicates the direction of the current flow from the anode to the cathode. Again, refer to the schematic for proper alignment. When looking at the PCB with the text facing upright, the cathode should go on the left hand side (connected to its current limiting resistor). There are three different color LEDs. D1 is red (VIN), D2-D5 are green (connected to the MCU), and D6-D8 are blue (connected to the FPGA). After finishing this step, you are finished with all the SMT components!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: LED and current limiting resistors.\n\n\n\n\nNow it’s time to tackle the THT components. Put the components into their respective places and solder them in. Pay careful attention to ensure that the female header strips are correctly aligned and perpendicular to the board. You will need to snap off 2- and 3-pin headers from the provided 40-pin header strip in order to populate J2-J4. The easiest way to do this is to use a pair of needle nose pliers to snap off the right number of pins.\nAfter finishing the main development board, follow the same procedure to assemble the breadboard adapter PCB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Make sure the notches are both pointing the same direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) The triangle on the connector should match with the red wire in the ribbon cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Crimping alignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Ribbon cable alignment procedure.\n\n\n\nUse the included insulation-displacement contact (IDC) ribbon cable connectors and the spool of ribbon cable in the lab to make yourself a short (~6-12”) cable. You have probably done this before in E80, but if you don’t remember how, see the video here. Cut the cable to length with the flush cutters in the toolbox and use either a vise or the cable assembly tool found in the E155 cabinet. Please make sure to put it back after you are finished. If you can’t find it around the lab, ask an instructor.\nFinally, solder the 20-pin male headers and 2x20 pin cable connector onto the breadboard adapter PCB, making sure that the pins are all correctly aligned and perpendicular to the PCB.\nCongratulations, you are now finished assembling your board and ready to test it! The photo below shows an example of what the board should look like when it is finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Fully assembled development board."

    "section": "Powering the Board",
    "text": "Powering the Board\nThere are three different ways to power the components on the development board: (1) via the VIN power input, (2) via the FPGA’s USB connection, and (3) via the MCU’s USB connection. In this section we will walk through the various ways to power the board to make sure that you are aware of how to properly power the board and avoid any issues which might damage the components on board.\nThe +5 V and +3.3 V voltage regulators provide power for the various components. All logic levels are +3.3 V unless stated otherwise. So, the +3.3 V supply is used to power the various buttons on the board.\n\nPowering through VIN\nTo power through VIN, apply a voltage to the power screw terminal between VIN and GND. The NCP117 series can accept voltages up to +20 V but in most scenarios you will likely want to use a VIN between +6-12 V. Be aware that VIN should always be more than +5 V for both regulators to function properly. When powering via VIN, the jumpers J3 (FPGA_+5V) and J4 (MCU_+5V) should be shorted in order to apply the +5 V output from the regulator to the MCU and FPGA +5 V pin.\n\n\nPowering via USB\nIt is also possible to power the board via a USB connection to either the MCU or FPGA board. Each board has an onboard voltage regulator to create a stabilized +5 V output on the boards respective +5 V pins. Assuming J3 and J4 are shorted, this +5 V output from whichever board is connected to USB power is fed back to the +5 V line (which is also the output of the +5 V regulator) and thus powers the other components connected to that net.\n\nTesting Voltage Regulators: Before connecting your MCU and FPGA boards, check the voltage regulators are on correctly by connecting to a lab DC power supply using the screw terminals and using a multimeter to confirm that the +3.3 V rail is +3.3 V and the +5 V rail is +5 V. If you read +5 V on the +3.3 V or vice versa, you have installed the regulators in the wrong place and need to swap them. If you read a low voltage (less than ~0.1 V), you likely have a bad solder joint on the back pad of the respective regulator and need to reflow the solder joint to make a better connection."

This will ensure that the board is working properly and that you have good communication between the two devices.\nTo familiarize yourself with how to program the FPGA using Lattice Radiant, see the Lattice Radiant iCE40 UltraPlus Project Setup tutorial. This tutorial has information about how to create a project in Radiant and how to synthesize and upload designs to your FPGA board.\nAfter working through the tutorial, download the Radiant project file fpga_dev_board_test.zip under the Lab 1 subfolder from the course GitHub (the link on the course website lab page) and use it to program your FPGA. This design toggles pin P25 at about 1 Hz. If you have the switch properly set on SW7, P25 is connected to PA9 and so you will see LED D3 blinking.\nAfter programming your FPGA, the next step is to upload the code to the MCU that will read the value of the toggled LED from the FPGA and echo it back on another pin. See the tutorial titled “Segger Embedded Studio Setup” to familiarize yourself with the process of installing and setting up SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES) for ARM. If you are using a lab computer, SES is already installed. Make sure that you use the ARM version of the program. The lab computers may also have other versions installed.\nAfter working through the tutorial, download the SES solution folder from the course GitHub titled “mcu_dev_board_test.zip”. Then, double click on the .emProject file or use the File → Open Solution option in SES to open the solution. This project contains a simple program that monitors the status of PA9 (which is connected to P25 through the appropriate jumper on J5. Make sure you have the jumper attached to connect PA9 to P25). Build and download the project to your MCU.\nNow, in addition to LED D3 (PA9/P25) blinking, you should see LED D2 (PA10/P23) and LED D7 (P38) blinking as well."

The report should not exceed one page of text, plus schematics, code, and anything else appropriate, such as diagrams, simulation results, or calculations. The report typically has the following sections:\n\nIntroduction: Briefly explain what was done.\nDesign and Testing Methodology: Explain how you approached the design of this assignment from both a software and a hardware standpoint (as appropriate). Include how you tested your design. These tests should convince the reader that the requirements of the assignment have been met.\nTechnical Documentation: Include your Verilog code and schematics of your circuits.\n\nQuality and clarity of your code is important. Make sure it is adequately commented. Succinct code using standard idioms is best.\nSchematics of your breadboarded circuits should be sufficient for another engineer to understand and reconstruct the circuit on the breadboard. Always use standard symbols for standard components such as resistors, switches, transistors, diodes, etc. Give the component name or part number such that the reader could order parts and replicate your circuit, or look up components in a datasheet where necessary. The reader shouldn’t have to open you HDL synthesis program to relate your Verilog code to the schematic, and shouldn’t need to refer to a data sheet to wire external components or understand what the connections are. Don’t assume that the reader has memorized the pinouts of any chips. Therefore, you’ll need to label both the pin number and pin name for each pin you use from the FPGA board or other component (e.g., 7-segment display). There is no need to draw any of the circuitry on the board; just refer to it by the pins number and name.\n\nResults and Discussion: Did you accomplish all of the prescribed tasks? If not, what are the shortcomings? How might you address them given more time? As appropriate, how did the design perform (ex. How fast/accurate/reliable was it?). Is there anything you would do differently if you were to redo the lab? Is there anything else interesting worth mentioning?\nConclusions: Briefly summarize what was done and how it performed.\nHow many hours did you spend working on the lab? Any comments, suggestions, or complaints about the assignment? This will not count toward your grade, but will help refine the lab for the future.\n\nThe report does not need to be long but should be complete. Some individual questions may not apply to this particular lab but are listed to give you a general idea of what is desired. Future reports will follow a similar format and the questions may be more applicable in these instances.\nHave your lab checked off by the instructor. You will need to demonstrate that the board and 7-segment display operate correctly. You will also be asked a question about some part of the lab or your board. You should be thoroughly familiar with all of the lab and the components of your board to be able to answer the question. The oral exam is typically in the form of a “Fault-Tolerance Question.” What would happen if a particular wire is broken or a pin is shorted to Vcc or GND? Be prepared for any other questions about your lab, however."

Double check to make sure that the pins are isolated and not connected together by checking the resistance between the pins with a multimeter.\nYou are trying to use a pin that is shared between the FPGA and the MCU and the MCU is not leaving that pin floating or it is driving it as an output. You can get around this by wiping the code on the MCU by uploading a file with a blank main function.\nYou should also read through the Nucleo board documentation to see what pins have special functions that are used by default by the MCU.

(Forgive the early internet engineers for this indulgence; I’m sure it sounded really cool at the time.) Hypertext is specified using a compact programming language called hypertext markup language or HTML. It is transferred over the internet based on a predefined set of agreements between all computers which is referred to as the hypertext transfer protocol or HTTP. The latter most of these acronyms should be familiar: whenever you type http:// into a web browser you are informing your computer that you are attempting to retrieve hypertext from the address that follows.\nThere are two common tools that interact with HTTP: the web browser, which lives on a receiving computer, sends internet requests, and renders the received hypertext; and the web server, which listens for requests from the internet and sends out hypertext in response.\nImplementing an HTTP web server on the ARM microcontroller is a non-trivial task. Instead, you will be using an ESP8266, a small WiFi development board which incorporates a TCP/IP stack as well as onboard WiFi and an integrated antenna. You are provided an Arduino language program which hosts an HTTP web server with an HTML page generated by the MCU."

    "text": "ESP8266-MCU Interface\nDownload the Lab 6 starter code and support files from the class web page. You may use any code we have developed in class to help you write your code.\nESP8266 development boards are available from the E155 supply closet and are pre-programmed with the webserver code. The SSID for the WiFi access points associated with each board is Lab6_ESP_xx where xx is the number listed on each board.\nThe ESP8266 board requires 3.3 V power. However, it has an onboard regulator so you can power the board with between 3-6 V using the V+ and GND pins. If after supplying power to the chip and waiting for it to initialize you do not see the expected WiFi network appear, you may need to reprogram the chip with the provided code.\nThe MCU must supply a webpage to the ESP8266, and must interpret any web browser requests from the ESP8266. The devices interface through a 125000 baud serial UART connection on the MCU and the UART TX and RX lines of the ESP8266. Note that with a UART connection the receive and transmit lines should be crossed. In other words, the TX of the transmitter should be connected to the RX of the receiver and the RX of the transmitter should be connected to the TX of the receiver.\nThe protocol is as follows:\n\nWhen the ESP8266 updates the webpage from the MCU, it sends the most recent request from the client, within /REQ:'...'\\n. For example, a user accessing the page http://&lt;server_address&gt;/ledon would result in the request /REQ:ledonn being sent to the microcontroller. A user accessing the root webpage of the server, http://&lt;server_address&gt;/ would result in the request /REQ:\\n. Note that you must use http:// and not https://.\nThe MCU then transmits the entire web page to the ESP8266. The ESP8266 expects a webpage encoded as an HTML file. Therefore the webpage must start with ‘&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;’ and end with ‘&lt;/html&gt;’. The ESP will wait for either &lt;/html&gt; or 200 ms from the last byte sent over serial before terminating the HTTP request and forwarding the content to the web browser.\n\nThe ESP8266 will create a WiFi access point named whatever SSID is labeled on the board. Connect to this WiFi network, and then go to http://192.168.4.1/. Beware that the ESP is slow and it may sometimes take a few attempts to connect."

See Appendix A-1 for an example of the key expansion during each round and Appendix B for an example of the intermediate results during each round.\nA PDF of the standard can be found here.\n\nImplementation\nDownload the starter source code and libraries from the course website. The provided MCU libraries (included in the lib subdirectory of the project) support a number of peripherals on the MCU so that you can directly use them and do not need to write them yourself.\nExamine aes_starter.sv, sbox.txt. aes_starter.sv contains the top-level module, an SPI interface, and two testbenches. The testbench module tests the entire system including the SPI link. The testbench_aes_core module is a separate testbench that tests only the aes_core module without the SPI link. It is suggested that you use testbench_aes_core first to check your core and then test the whole system including the SPI link with the full testbench. These testbenches apply and check the test vector described in Appendix A-1 and B.\nThe starter code also contains the mixcolumns logic that operates on a 128-bit intermediate state. The Galois field arithmetic for mixcolumns is more complicated than for the rest of AES, and the implementation is based on a paper cited in the code. The sbox module and sbox.txt lookup table perform the sbox substitution on a single byte.\nThe MCU code lab7.c sends a key and plaintext message over SPI to the FPGA, then checks that the result is correct. Set up your project to target the FPGA on your board and develop the remaining modules necessary to implement AES. You will need to carefully read the specification to figure out what these are and how to connect them. Starting with a high-level block diagram of the system is a very helpful step to make sure that you are understanding the AES procedure correctly. The MCU starter code can be opened directly in SEGGER Embedded Studio and directly compiled and uploaded to the MCU and does not need any further modification.\nYou will discover that the logic is too large to implement all the rounds as one giant block of combinational logic. Therefore, you will need to perform the rounds sequentially. You will also need to pay careful attention to the timing within each round since you need to allow for the one-cycle latency required to perform the sbox byte substitution which uses the synchronous RAM blocks.\nTurn in the usual report including design approach, block diagram, code, schematics, results, and time spent."

    "text": "Hints\nPrevious students have spent a highly variable amount of time on this lab. Here are some suggestions to make it go faster.\n\nStart by thoroughly understanding the specification\nIn prior labs you may have gotten in the habit of thinking in code. Remember to go back to thinking about hardware rather than function calls. Draw a block diagram for your hardware using elements such as registers, multiplexers, FSMs, and blocks of combinational logic. Name all of the signals between blocks. Remember how the E85 multicycle processor had a datapath that required certain control signals such as mux selects, and a controller that generates the control signals at the appropriate times. You’ll find a similar organization helpful. Write idiomatic Verilog code that exactly matches your block diagram.\n\n\nWatch for warnings in synthesis and simulation, and correct these before moving ahead.\nGet your design working in simulation first. When debugging, find the first place you can tell a signal is wrong. Add all the relevant inputs that influence that signal. If one of them is wrong, recursively work backward. When the inputs are good and the output is bad, you’ve isolated the bug and can look for it in that part of the code. Learn to do this systematically so you can find and solve each bug in minutes rather than hours.\nIf the design works in simulation but not on hardware, it is often a wiring error or a discrepancy between how you timed your control signals and what the C code expects. Make sure you’ve read the provided code carefully and are producing signals at the right times. Check that your FPGA and microcontroller are expecting the same polarity and phase for your SPI clock signal. Use the many channels of the logic analyzer to view all of the relevant signals at once and check them against your expectations. If you have a hard bug, it’s helpful to tap out intermediate signals, such as the state of a FSM, onto FPGA pins so you can watch them on the logic analyzer.\nHave fun! This is a sophisticated system and you should feel proud when you have built and debugged it!"

    "text": "Discussion\nTime-multiplexing is a technique to share a common expensive hardware resource for several purposes at different times. For example, the multicycle processor in E85 multiplexed the memory for both instruction and data access and multiplexed the ALU for data processing instructions, branch calculations, and program counter increments.\nIn this lab, you will time-multiplex your seven-segment decoder module to run both halves of a dual display. A convenient way to control which half is active is to turn ON the common anode of only one display at a time. The anode requires substantial current, more than an FPGA output pin can drive. You can use a transistor to drive the large current. The lab has a stock of 2N3906 PNP transistors suitable for this purpose. Be sure to limit the base current so that you don’t draw too much current from the FPGA pin and choose a suitable switching speed. If you switch too slowly, your eye will notice the flicker. If you switch too fast for the electronics, the two digits will bleed together."

Display the last two hexadecimal digits pressed on your dual seven-segment display, with the most recent entry appearing at the right. The keypad and your display should be in the same orientation.\nEach key press should be recorded exactly once, at the time the key is pressed, no matter how long or short a time the user holds the key down. If additional keys are pressed while still holding down the first key, these inputs should be ignored.

When you press a key, the corresponding row and column are connected. Check this with a multimeter to confirm your pinout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Pinout of keypads.\n\n\n\nMechanical switches are prone to a phenomenon called switch bounce, where the switch makes and breaks its connection repeatedly on a time scale of microseconds to a few milliseconds. You should design your system in such a way that a single keypress registers only once even if there is some momentary bounce.\nThis is a thinking person’s lab. If you thoroughly understand the problem and design a simple scanner circuit, you can complete the lab fairly efficiently. If you go by trial and error, you may find yourself in lab indefinitely. You will need to generate rather complex stimuli to simulate your keypad scanner. Many students have been tempted to skip simulating and debug on the real hardware. Almost all have regretted it. Similarly, some students have been lured down the path of asynchronous design, at their peril.\n\n\nWhat to Turn In\nWhen you are done, have your lab checked off by the instructor. You should thoroughly understand how it works and what would happen if any changes were made. Turn in your lab writeup including the following information:\n\nSchematics of the breadboarded circuit.\nYour Verilog code and simulation results.\nA complete state transition diagram which illustrates the states of your system and the transitions between states. Remember that the transitions from each state should be completely described – in other words, the transitions should cover all possible combinations of the potential inputs.\nHow many hours did you spend on the lab? This will not count toward your grade.\n\n\n\nHints\nLook at your RTL schematic in your synthesis tool (Tools -&gt; Netlist Analyzer). Understand why your code produces the hardware you see.

Once your project is created, download the starter code and put it in your src folder or create a new file inside your src directory titled sort.s and copy in the contents of the starter code.\nFinish writing the assembly language subroutine under label main in sort.S to sort 12 signed bytes (the ones on the .byte … line under arr). Remember that assembly language code is nearly unreadable without line- by-line comments. If needed, use online reference sheets for ARM Thumb2 Assembly language (like the one linked on the course website) or refer to Chapter 6 of Digital Design and Computer Architecture.\n\nNote: If you are running code on your Nucleo while it is connected to the development board, make sure that you remove the UPduino_+5V jumper to avoid powering the FPGA. Also note that you must have the MCU_+5V jumper connected in order to power the voltage regulators and ensure that the MCU reset signal is pulled high.\n\n\n\nRunning and Testing Your Code\nBuild your code and enter a debug session. With the MCU board connected via USB, start a debugging session by going to the debug section of the sidebar and pressing the green arrow in the top of the menu (or by using the keyboard shortcut F5).\nExamine the memory location where the array of signed bytes has been loaded using the memory location viewer. The memory viewer is normally located near the bottom of the program window, but if you can’t find it, you can access it through the “View” menu in the program toolbar.\nYou may also choose to use the “Watch” section of the debugger. For example, if you want to view the contents of the byte array stored in memory, you can enter *(char[12] *) arr as a Watch expression. This tells the watch window to cast the address of the arr label to a pointer to a character and dereference 12 consecutive values from that memory location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: SEGGER Embedded Studio (SES).\n\n\n\nStep through the operation of your program and see how it changes the values of the array stored in memory.\nTo test your code, try various cases with the array in the .byte... line under the arr label. Rebuild and start a new debug session every time you make changes."

Instead, sign up for a time to get your lab checked off. Please sign up for a time during your lab section. If you are unable to find a spot that works for you, see if you can swap with one of your classmates. If you are still having trouble finding a time that works for you, reach out and let me know.\n“Office hours” is code for “come hang out.” You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions, get help with your labs, talk about careers and graduate school, or chat about something on your mind (whether it is related to this class, academics, or anything else). In addition to things related to Engineering, embedded systems, digital electronics, and microcontrollers, a short (but not comprehensive!) list of things I enjoy talking about are sports (MLB: NY Mets; NFL: Tennessee Titans), running/biking/hiking, life design, time management, or books/essays I’m reading. I am available more often than not, so try dropping me a line via Slack or email if you are having a problem with your lab or want to set up a time. You may also contact the lab assistant(s) for questions when I am not available.\n\n\n\nPlease note that I do not always respond immediately to messages. In particular I typically do not check email or Discord between 6:00 pm and 6:00 am on weeknights, and I typically do not check these at all on weekends.\nThat said,\n\nMessages sent on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 4:00 pm PT will get a response the same day.\nMessages sent after 4:00 pm PT Monday-Thursday will get a response the next day.\nMessages sent after 4:00 pm PT on Fridays or on the weekend will get a response the following Monday.\n\n\n\n\nThe overarching goal of this course is to take you from a basic familiarity and knowledge of digital design with field gate programmable arrays (FPGAs) and microcontrollers programming and expand your capabilities to design, build, and test embedded systems. In particular, by the end of this course you should be able to:\n\nDesign and implement combinational and sequential circuits on an FPGA.\nUse an ARM-based microcontroller to interface with the real world via sensors and actuators.\nBuild an embedded system project of your own design from the ground up.\nSelect appropriate embedded hardware for a given task and use the appropriate hardware for a given problem.\nEffectively and efficiently debug electrical systems with measurement tools such as an oscilloscope and logic analyzer.\nRead and understand complicated datasheets at a level that enables you to incorporate them into your designs.\nClearly communicate technical results in a professional manner through oral presentations and written reports.\n\nIn broad strokes, MicroPs can be divided into two halves. The first half of the class focuses on giving you fundamental embedded systems concepts in lecture which you learn by experience through seven, hands-on labs. These labs are designed to be loosely structured design projects – you will be given information about the required specifications and some pointers on how to get started, but much of the development process is left open to you. The second half of the class is mainly focused on the project. The project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate independent and creative mastery of embedded system design in teams of two. The specific project task is very open-ended; the only requirement is that the project does something fun or useful and that it meaningfully uses both the FPGA and MCU. In addition to having a series of design review checkpoints, you will give a mid-project presentation to the class and a final presentation of your project when finished. The content of the lectures in the second half of the class focuses on exposing you to more advanced embedded systems concepts and exploring a range of various types of external hardware that may be useful to use in your project.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ultimate goal for this course is to help you to master the material and become skilled embedded systems developers who understand how to build a system from a set of requirements and specifications and to verify that the system meets those specifications.\nHere are a few of the main pedagogical concepts that you can expect to see in this course.\n\nTransparent Teaching – you should not have to guess what you are supposed to get out of a given activity or assignment in this class. I strive to be as transparent about why we are doing what we are doing. This is most clearly articulated through explicit learning goals that accompany each lecture, lab, or project. If the purpose of anything we do in this class is ever unclear, please ask me and I will be happy to clarify it.\nPsychological Safety – A psychologically safe environment is one where each person feels able to share their questions, concerns, or mistakes without feeling embarrassed or looked down upon by others. Building a psychologically safe classroom is a joint venture which I expect each of you to join with me in pursuing.\nA Growth Mindset – growth can only happen when you reach the end of what you already know. Each of you coming into this class will have different levels of experience with the types of skills that are useful in this class like working with embedded systems, programming, debugging, design, etc. My goal as an instructor is to take you from wherever you are and bring you as far along in your journey as possible. To do that, I encourage each of you to ask questions and push yourself to the edge of your knowledge. It can be frustrating or embarrassing to have questions that you feel you should already have the answer to. You should take these moments as opportunities to ask questions and fill the gaps in your knowledge. In the end, having a growth mindset is strongly linked with deep curiosity about what you are learning and a realization that while being honest about the limits of your understanding might be challenging, embracing that discomfort allows you to grow and improve quickly.\nFrequent, Low-stakes Testing – Research has shown that having frequent opportunities to assess your knowledge is a powerful way to learn and correct any misconceptions. One way that this will take place is through regular in-class quizzes and activities.\nInterleaving – The scheduling of the material is arranged in such a way that you will return to many similar concepts throughout the semester with some time in between. The goal of this is to have you return to familiar concepts after some time away so that you reinforce the material after working on something else. This has been shown to improve long-term retention of the material (see Small Teaching by James Lang if you are curious in learning more).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeek\nTuesday’s Class\nThursday’s Class\nDue\n\n\n\n\n8/27\nIntro & Analog Behavior of Digital Systems\nCombinational and Sequential Logic\n(Lab Demos)\n\n\n9/3\nVerilog Coding\nSynchronous Design\nLab 1 - Development Board Assembly\n\n\n9/10\nFPGA Documentation\nArchitecture & Assembly Review\nLab 2 - Muxed 7-Segment Display\n\n\n9/17\nAssembly Programming\nC Programming on an MCU\nLab 3 - Keypad\n\n\n9/24\nClock Configuration\nTimers\nLab 4 - ARM Assembly Sort\n\n\n10/1\nSerial Interfaces Overview & SPI\nUART and the IoT\nLab 5 - Digital Audio\n\n\n10/8\nPCB Design\nAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES)\nLab 6 - SPI & The Internet of Things\n\n\n10/15\nHappy Fall Break!

We will not be closely following a textbook, but you may find The Definitive Guide to ARM® Cortex®-M3 and Cortex®-M4 Processors by Joseph Yiu to be a helpful, comprehensive reference for the microcontroller. An electronic version of the book is available through the library (link).\n\n\n\nThe grading for this class is based on a variation of specifications-grading and may be a bit different than what you have seen in other classes. If you have questions or concerns, please contact the instructors for clarification.\nThe grade you earn in the class will be determined based the number of deliverables you successfully complete and the level of polish to which you complete them across three different bundles:\n\nLabs\nProject\nIn-class participation.\n\nEach assignment will contain a list of specifications (or specs) for two levels of completeness: proficiency and excellence. The list of specifications are designed to be aligned with the learning goals for the assignment. The proficiency specifications will indicate the level of completeness that demonstrates that you have achieved a level of comfort with the material in the assignment such that you would be able to implement the learning outcomes in a different setting. Excellence specs are above and beyond proficiency specs. Meeting the excellence specs for an assignment indicates that you have not only achieved the basic level of expected knowledge of the material, but have truly understood and are able to apply the techniques with deftness.\nThe table below describes the levels that you need to meet in each bundle (i.e., column) in order to earn the grade in the respective row. To earn the grade in a given row, you must meet all the criteria in that row. In other words, to get a B, you must complete the following:\n\nAll 7 labs to the proficiency specs and 4 of those labs must meet the excellence specs.\nAll 5 project elements must meet proficiency specs and 3 of them must meet the excellence specs.\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nLabs\nProject\n\n\n\n\nF\nP \\(\\lt\\) 5\nP \\(\\lt\\) 4\n\n\nD\nP \\(\\geq\\) 5, E \\(\\geq\\) 1\nP \\(\\geq\\) 4\n\n\nC\nP \\(\\geq\\) 6, E \\(\\geq\\) 2\nP \\(\\geq\\) 4, E \\(\\geq\\) 2\n\n\nB\nP = 7, E \\(\\geq\\) 4\nP = 5, E \\(\\geq\\) 3\n\n\nA\nP = 7, E \\(\\geq\\) 5\nP = 5, E \\(\\geq\\) 4\n\n\n\nPerformance on the labs and project is weighted equally. +/- grades will be assigned for situations in which your performance falls between the conditions for each row.\nIn-class participation is also an important part of practicing and learning this material and can help to boost your grade in the class by up to half a letter grade (e.g., from a B- to a B or B+ to an A-). As one example, if you meet the requirements for an A in the labs bundle but the requirements for a B in the project bundle, you can expect to earn either a B+ or A-. In these situations, your in-class participation is a contributing factor to split the difference between the - of the higher tier and the + of the lower tier.\n\n\nIn general, each deliverable must be submitted before it’s due date. However, you will have several tokens which will allow you to exercise an option for an extension on an assignment or revisit a previous assignment to raise it from it’s initially submitted level to a higher level of specifications.\n\n\nThis token may be used for a one-week extension on any lab with no penalty. For example, you could choose to use this token to submit your lab 3 at the same time as lab 4.\n\n\n\nYou may use these tokens to revise a previously submitted assignment to try to meet a higher level of specifications. These tokens may always be used to attempt to upgrade an assignment from proficiency to excellence specs. In general, they may not be used to reassess an assignment which did not meet proficiency specs when it was originally due. The instructors reserve the right to waive this policy at their discretion (e.g., to allow a lab which nearly meets proficiency specs by the due date to be reassessed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI tools like ChatGPT are an emerging and active area of research. Following the public release of ChatGPT in late 2022, large language models (LLMs) hit the mainstream and have been the subject of robust conversations about how educators and students should approach these tools. AI tools, whether in the form of an LLM or something else, are likely to have an impact on your career and work as an engineer. In this class, we will be approaching AI tools with a posture of cautious engagement. The guiding principle for the use of AI tools is that these tools must be used in the spirit of the assignment.\nTo frame the discussion about AI in this class, here are three general ways that educators are approaching AI use in their classes1:\n\nBan\nEmbrace\nCritical exploration\n\nEach of these approaches has its merits in specific circumstances. The key is to ensure that the use of the tool is aligned with the overarching learning outcomes of the course or assignment. There are some instances where AI use is not aligned with learning. For example, it is important to understand the fundamentals of how to write accurate code in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as the SystemVerilog language we will learn in this class. Relying on a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT to write the code for you will supplant rather than support your ability to understand the important concepts for designing digital systems. Not to mention that ChatGPT, based on my experience, writes really bad HDL!2\nThere are other instances where an embrace of AI is worth considering. Maybe after building your own general understanding of SystemVerilog you want to experiment with an LLM to see if it can generate a template design that you can slightly modify for a new design. In this situation, the LLM is acting more like an advanced auto-complete tool. The key is that you possess the expertise to be able to understand and analyze whether the output is correct. In the spirit of full embrace, you may try to have an LLM write your code for you, comment your code, or write descriptions of what the code is doing. Embracing the AI tool full on will help you to quickly generate text, but the quality of the output may end up being incorrect or of poor quality. User beware.\nThe third approach is in the middle of the previous two, approaching AI tools like LLMs with a cautious optimism and an eye towards reflection. Here, a user embraces the tool and engages their curiosity to prototype new ways in which the tool might be useful but is continually asking questions and reflecting on the approach and how the design of the tools influences the applications for which they are well suited. By diving deeply into how these tools work, analyzing their areas of strength and weakness, and experimenting with them with an attitude of critical curiosity, one can learn how these tools might be a valuable tool in the toolkit and other situations when they are best avoided. This approach also opens up space to ask questions about the array of ethical issues that must be discussed, including but not limited to: data privacy concerns, the environmental impacts of training these systems, alignment of AI tools with human values, bias, and the potentially dangerous ways in which these tools can be used.\nMy own approach to AI use is that when we choose to use it, we should be using it as a ladder and not a crutch. If and when we choose to use AI tools we should use it to extend our abilities but not in a way that might create unhealthy dependencies on it (e.g., not learning foundational programming concepts because ChatGPT can write the code for you). If you use AI tools in an unhealthy way, you are likely to be doing yourself more harm than good. In this vein, it is similar to other forms of academic dishonesty that supplant the learning intended as part of a given assignment or assessment.\nIf you have any questions or are curious about exploring AI tools in this class, please reach out and ask. Our default posture will be the third approach of reflective engagement. In most instances this means that we will avoid the use of these tools since they will often be in direct opposition to the goals of learning the fundamental concepts. If you would like to use these tools in an assignment, please reach out to me and I would be happy to talk with you about it. In general you will be required to submit a quick justification of\n\nWhat you would like to use the tool for.\nWhy you think the use of AI is aligned with and not opposed to the learning goals of the assignment.\nA short reflection, submitted with the assignment, on your experience using AI on the assignment and what you learned.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is not a textbook to purchase, you will need to buy a lab kit. The fee is $75 in Claremont Cash, and should be paid by filling out the Google Form (link) which authorizes Sydney Torrey in the Engineering office to charge your Claremont Cash account. Once you have paid for your kit via the form, see Sam Abdelmuati in the stockroom to pick up your kit. If you cook your board this semester, you can buy and rebuild a replacement, but ask the instructor for help troubleshooting first. You’ll also check out a large breadboard from the stockroom, and will need to return it at the end of the semester.\nThe kit fee can be waived in cases of financial hardship. To request a waiver fill out the form here (link). Course instructors will not know about waiver requests.\n\n\n\nThe Digital Lab (Parson B183) is available for you to use when working on your labs. The current door code will be shared on Slack when it is available. There are Windows PCs available with SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM and Lattice Radiant installed along with the drivers required to program your board. The lab also has the electronics assembly equipment needed to solder, oscilloscopes and power supplies at the lab stations, and a lab cabinet with various resistors and some of the parts like wires, seven-segment LEDs, and transistors you will need for some of your labs. You are welcome to use these while working on your lab, but please make sure to return the components to the lab cabinet when you are done.\nIn addition, the software we will be using for programming the MCU (SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM) and FPGA (Lattice Radiant) are free and supported on a variety of platforms if you wish to download them on your personal computer. SEGGER Embedded Studio is supported on Windows, MacOS, and Linux and Lattice Radiant is supported on Windows and Linux. If you are running MacOS, you can download and virtualize Windows using VMWare Fusion Player under a Personal Use License for free. More details and download links can be found here (link).\n\n\n\nStudents in this class are expected to follow the HMC honor code. An honor code policy appears below and prescribes behavior that is considered honorable, so read those maxims and follow them closely. Any honor code violations will be handled through JB.\n\n\n\n\nAll students enrolled in this course are bound by the HMC Honor Code. More information on the HMC Honor Code can be found in the HMC Student Handbook.\nIt is your responsibility to determine whether your actions adhere to the HMC Honor Code. If this document does not clarify the legitimacy of a particular action, you should contact the course instructor and request clarification.\nWork you submit for individual assignments should be your own, and you should complete all assignments based on your own understanding of the underlying material. If you work with, or receive help from, another individual on an assignment, provide a written acknowledgement in complete sentences that includes the person’s name and the nature of the help.\nThis document is not meant to be an exhaustive list of every possible Honor Code violation. Infractions not explicitly mentioned here may still violate the Honor Code.\nBoundaries of Collaboration Verbal collaboration with other students on individual assignments is encouraged AFTER you have given serious thought to each component yourself. However, all submitted written work should be written by yourself individually, and not a collaborative effort or copied from a common source (e.g., a chalkboard). It is NOT acceptable to work on labs in lockstep with another classmate.\nUse of Computer Software The use of graphing calculators and computer software to aid in course work is acceptable, as long as it does not substitute for an understanding of the course material.\nUse of Web Resources The use of Internet resources to aid in course work is acceptable, as long it does not substitute for an understanding of the course material. Plagiarism and direct copying from online (or any other) sources is strictly prohibited.\nUse of Your Own Work from Previous Semesters If you have previously attempted this course, you may resubmit your work from previous semesters as this semester’s coursework, as long as you understand the underlying material.\nUse of Other Course Resources from Previous Semesters You may not reference assignments (labs, problem sets, activities) of this course from previous semesters.\nRetention of Course Resources Assignments and exams from this course may not be committed to dorm repositories or otherwise used to help future students.\n\n\n\n\nWe do difficult work in this class and everyone should feel comfortable engaging with the material. We explicitly want you to feel safe doing this work, so it is worth stating that the instructors are committed to making the class a safe space for everyone regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, and academic history. If you feel that you are experiencing a hostile environment, speak to an instructor immediately.\n\n\n\nHMC is committed to providing an inclusive learning environment and support for all students. Students with a disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions) who may need some accommodation in order to fully participate in this class are encouraged to contact Educational Accessibility Services at ability@g.hmc.edu to request accommodations. Students from the other Claremont Colleges should contact their home college’s disability resources officer."

    "text": "The overarching goal of this course is to take you from a basic familiarity and knowledge of digital design with field gate programmable arrays (FPGAs) and microcontrollers programming and expand your capabilities to design, build, and test embedded systems. In particular, by the end of this course you should be able to:\n\nDesign and implement combinational and sequential circuits on an FPGA.\nUse an ARM-based microcontroller to interface with the real world via sensors and actuators.\nBuild an embedded system project of your own design from the ground up.\nSelect appropriate embedded hardware for a given task and use the appropriate hardware for a given problem.\nEffectively and efficiently debug electrical systems with measurement tools such as an oscilloscope and logic analyzer.\nRead and understand complicated datasheets at a level that enables you to incorporate them into your designs.\nClearly communicate technical results in a professional manner through oral presentations and written reports.\n\nIn broad strokes, MicroPs can be divided into two halves. The first half of the class focuses on giving you fundamental embedded systems concepts in lecture which you learn by experience through seven, hands-on labs. These labs are designed to be loosely structured design projects – you will be given information about the required specifications and some pointers on how to get started, but much of the development process is left open to you. The second half of the class is mainly focused on the project. The project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate independent and creative mastery of embedded system design in teams of two. The specific project task is very open-ended; the only requirement is that the project does something fun or useful and that it meaningfully uses both the FPGA and MCU. In addition to having a series of design review checkpoints, you will give a mid-project presentation to the class and a final presentation of your project when finished. The content of the lectures in the second half of the class focuses on exposing you to more advanced embedded systems concepts and exploring a range of various types of external hardware that may be useful to use in your project."

    "text": "The ultimate goal for this course is to help you to master the material and become skilled embedded systems developers who understand how to build a system from a set of requirements and specifications and to verify that the system meets those specifications.\nHere are a few of the main pedagogical concepts that you can expect to see in this course.\n\nTransparent Teaching – you should not have to guess what you are supposed to get out of a given activity or assignment in this class. I strive to be as transparent about why we are doing what we are doing. This is most clearly articulated through explicit learning goals that accompany each lecture, lab, or project. If the purpose of anything we do in this class is ever unclear, please ask me and I will be happy to clarify it.\nPsychological Safety – A psychologically safe environment is one where each person feels able to share their questions, concerns, or mistakes without feeling embarrassed or looked down upon by others. Building a psychologically safe classroom is a joint venture which I expect each of you to join with me in pursuing.\nA Growth Mindset – growth can only happen when you reach the end of what you already know. Each of you coming into this class will have different levels of experience with the types of skills that are useful in this class like working with embedded systems, programming, debugging, design, etc. My goal as an instructor is to take you from wherever you are and bring you as far along in your journey as possible. To do that, I encourage each of you to ask questions and push yourself to the edge of your knowledge. It can be frustrating or embarrassing to have questions that you feel you should already have the answer to. You should take these moments as opportunities to ask questions and fill the gaps in your knowledge. In the end, having a growth mindset is strongly linked with deep curiosity about what you are learning and a realization that while being honest about the limits of your understanding might be challenging, embracing that discomfort allows you to grow and improve quickly.\nFrequent, Low-stakes Testing – Research has shown that having frequent opportunities to assess your knowledge is a powerful way to learn and correct any misconceptions. One way that this will take place is through regular in-class quizzes and activities.\nInterleaving – The scheduling of the material is arranged in such a way that you will return to many similar concepts throughout the semester with some time in between. The goal of this is to have you return to familiar concepts after some time away so that you reinforce the material after working on something else. This has been shown to improve long-term retention of the material (see Small Teaching by James Lang if you are curious in learning more)."

There are Windows PCs available with SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM and Lattice Radiant installed along with the drivers required to program your board. The lab also has the electronics assembly equipment needed to solder, oscilloscopes and power supplies at the lab stations, and a lab cabinet with various resistors and some of the parts like wires, seven-segment LEDs, and transistors you will need for some of your labs. You are welcome to use these while working on your lab, but please make sure to return the components to the lab cabinet when you are done.\nIn addition, the software we will be using for programming the MCU (SEGGER Embedded Studio for ARM) and FPGA (Lattice Radiant) are free and supported on a variety of platforms if you wish to download them on your personal computer. SEGGER Embedded Studio is supported on Windows, MacOS, and Linux and Lattice Radiant is supported on Windows and Linux. If you are running MacOS, you can download and virtualize Windows using VMWare Fusion Player under a Personal Use License for free. More details and download links can be found here (link)."

If in doubt, err on the side of smaller. You will fail the class if you undertake a project that is too big and produce no completed work.\nA successful project will use both the FPGA and MCU and will perform a function that is useful or interesting. You also must use a new piece of hardware in your final project (various sensors or displays are popular choices). You can find examples of past final projects on the class web page. Examples include games, electromechanical systems, prototypes for a startup company, or elements of a Clinic project (with your advisor’s permission)."

    "text": "Deliverables\nYour team is responsible for the following deliverables at the dates described above:\n\nProject Proposal\nA 2-page proposal describing what you plan to build. It must be specific enough that I can tell when you demonstrate your project that it meets the specs of the proposal. Do not list stretch goals or wiggle words; simply state what you are committing to deliver. You may need to do some preliminary technical work to gain confidence you can deliver what you promise. Include a bill of materials with the parts you expect to need along with prices for any supplies that are not available in the stock room. Describe the main subsystems of the design and the features of the MCU that you plan to use. Explain the new piece(s) of hardware and show that both the FPGA and MCU are performing nontrivial functions appropriate to each. Include a block diagram showing the components and the interfaces between each.\n\n\nMidpoint Report & Demo\nA 4-page report (plus appendices) documenting your design at the midpoint. Your report should be submitted before your scheduled checkpoint slot. The status report should include:\n\nSchematics of anything on a breadboard,\nBlock diagrams of the logic on your FPGA,\nAn outline of the routines used on the MCU.\n\nYou should include as an appendix either your Verilog code or software that is mostly complete (but do not have to have both ready). You must be ready to demonstrate some working hardware in the lab.\n\n\nPresentations\nYour team will sign up for a 10-minute in-class presentation shortly after your proposal debrief. Your presentation should include a 3-minute overview of your project followed by an in-depth presentation of a specific technical problem your team is working on and has not yet solved. The goal of the presentation is to get input from other students who might have ideas of how to solve your problem so you must explain the problem clearly enough to get meaningful suggestions back.\n\n\nProject Demonstration\nDemonstrate a working project to the instructor in the lab. There will be signups for demonstration periods, during which you will show that you meet your specifications and be asked technical questions about the operation of your design. Come prepared with printouts of your schematics, software and Verilog. If your project is one day late, one letter grade will be deducted.\n\n\nFinal Report\nThe final report for this project will be a portfolio website hosted on Github pages. The website should document your design with all source code in the linked Github repository. Clearly explain how your design works. If you have developed techniques that would be useful for students in the future (e.g., how to interface to an LCD display), document these features well so that future students may build on your work.\nThe website should include:\n\nComplete schematics and block diagrams\nWell-commented and cleanly-formatted code (C and Verilog)\nPhotos of your finished design\nA video (hosted in the provided Google Drive folder) demonstrating your project. Any videos should be titled “&lt;LastName1&gt;&lt;LastName2&gt;&lt;VideoName&gt;” to clearly identify your videos in the folder.\n\nLate projects will not be accepted except in the case of unusual extenuating circumstances. Be careful to choose a project within a scope that you can reasonably expect to finish. If you realize your project is too large, contact me as soon as possible to renegotiate your project proposal. I will not accept revisions to the proposal after the Friday following the in-class presentation."
